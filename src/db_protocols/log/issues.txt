REG: FAR
CITATION: 1.106
ARTICLE CLASS: 2Col
NOTE: Why call it this? this is literally the only class called this out of all the regulations.

REG: FAR
CITATION: 3.1
ARTICLE CLASS: TOP
NOTE: Same with '2Col' - why even call it this? Was this supposed to be 'TORP'? This is the only class name out of all the regulations.

REG: FAR
CITATION: 37.1
ARTICLE CLASS: TOLP
NOTE: Same with '2Col' - why even call it this? Was this supposed to be 'TORP'? This is the only class name out of all the regulations.

REG: FAR
CITATION: (Various)
ARTICLE CLASS: TORP, ANYWHERE
NOTE: The TORP class is only for the X.000 part of each regulation, but why use this if we have 'nested1'? 'ANYWHERE' is the same: it is used for subparts, but why not just use 'nested2'?

- Several articles have the same clases nested within them. I feel these should be 'nested' as their names suggest, and not have the same classes as their nested siblings. The following articles have the same class as their nested counterparts:
    - Subpart 3.1
    - Part 4
    - Subpart 4.21
    - Subpart 14.1
    - Subpart 17.1
    - Subpart 24.1
    - Subpart 29.1
    - Subpart 29.4
    - Part 29
    - Subpart 37.1
    - Subpart 38.1
    - Subpart 43.1
    - Subpart 44.1
    - Subpart 45.1
    - Subpart 46.1
    - Subpart 50.1
    - Subpart 51.1
    - Subpart 52.1


#################################### Typos ####################################
REG: EPAAR
CITATION: 1519.2
HEADER TITLE: 1509.203 - 1519.204
NOTE: Should be 1519.203, not 1509.203.

- SOFARS 5602 title has no space between the citation and Definitions

#################################### SOFARS ###################################
- SOFARS regulations don't even show thte citations, despite being there in the html: they list ordered lists but the citations don't show - isn't this pretty drastic? In order to cite properly, we need to at least know the citation...
- TOC items:
    - Many are concatenated together; why not just separate each one on each line?
    - The other sections have a real TOC nested between two hr's, but then everything is concatenated together underneat it: why on Earth is this even here?
- There are no headings at all for the text - many are just plain text
- 5602 and 5603 title has no space between the citation and Definition
- Citations are in the same paragarph as the text: they should be separated


############################## Continuity Issues ##############################
- 1539.2071 and 2409.470 contains 'ยง' as their first character: is this even required?

- 2426.7001-2426.7002 and 1509.203-1519.204 are both reserved but they are grouped together: why not just have them separate?

- The 258.7006 ASSIGNMENTS sections in the DFARS PGI have underscores for spaces and have the numbers next to their parts: why not just spell them out normally?

- 'Reserved' sections are either empty, wrapped in square brackets, parenthesis, or in caps: they should be all one
