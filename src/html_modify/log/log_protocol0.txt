The General Services Administration Acquisition Management System consists of the General Services Administration Acquisition Regulation (GSAR) and agency and Service non-regulatory acquisition policies and procedures guidance documents. The General Services Administration Acquisition Manual (GSAM) consolidates acquisition policies and procedures for all GSA personnel.                </p>
